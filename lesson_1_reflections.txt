How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff is very helpful in identifying the difference between the 2 files.  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Seeing revisions of your file will help you see the progress of your work more efficiently.  It will help you keep track of what was changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You can freely decide when to commit but will sometimes tend to forget.  If you are forgetful, saving it automatically will help.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Google has its own system.
